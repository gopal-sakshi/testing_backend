There are four core concepts to define OOP
    Encapsulation
    Abstraction
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism

`Abstraction`
- only expose the necessary details
- to reach abstraction, we have multiple ways
    abstract class
    interfaces
    types



`Encapsulation`
- it is built on the idea of hiding data


`Polymorphism`
- the ability to create a class with more than one form. 
- classes have the same methods but different implementations
