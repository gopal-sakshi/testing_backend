/*

Function hoisting
- use a function before you declare it in your code.


Variable hoisting
- However JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations
- meaning, initialization doesn't happen until the associated line of code is executed, 
    even if the variable was originally initialized then declared, or declared and initialized in the same line.

CASE I

    var hoisting
    let, const hoisting
    class hoisting
    function expression, class expression hoisting
