As per Harsh

JS has 
a) micro task queue
b) callback queue
c) Call Stack

Whenever callstack is empty 
---> JS engine looks for microtask queue (always high priority that callback queue)
---> only after all promises/pending things in microtask queue are over ---> JS engine goes to callback queue
---> If stack is not empty
    first, JS engine executes stuff in stack
