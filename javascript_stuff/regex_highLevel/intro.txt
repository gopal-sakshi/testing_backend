create Regex
    const re = /ab+c/;
        this is generally used
    const re = new RegExp('ab+c');
        Use the constructor function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or
        you don't know the pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.
        MEANING = using constructor function provides runtime compilation of the regular expression

methods of RegExp
    exec()
    test() 
methods of String
    match(regex_exp23)
        if regex_exp23 = not used global flag
            return value = array... 
            elements of array
                1st, 2nd, 3rd elements of the array = results of matching pattern in the input string
                4th elemnt = index of 1st occurence
                5th element = input string
                6th element = groups (if capture groups is used)
        if regex_exp23 = used global flag
            return value = array
            elements of array = results of matching pattern in the input string
            index & groups wont occur it seems ??
    matchAll()
    replace()
    replaceAll()
    search()
    split() 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- simple pattern
    characters for which you want to find a direct match
- special characters
    finding one or more b's
    finding white space
    /ab*c/ ---------------> single "a" followed by zero or more "b"s followed by "c"
