object 
- a collection of key-value pairs.
- Each key-value pair is known as property, where 
    key = name of the property 
    value = value of the property
- a way to group several values into a single value
- Javascript objects can have any number of properties (0 = empty object)



2 kinds of properties in JavaScript. 
- Data Properties & Accessor Properties.
- Data Property
    It maps to a value
- The Accessor property 
    - does not map to a value but to accessor functions. 
    - The accessor functions (known as getter & setter functions) contain the logic to store or retrieve the value.


Ways to Create Objects in Javascript
- Object Literal
- new keyword, constructor function
- Object.create()
- ES6 Class
- Object.assign()

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Object Methods
- JS allows us to store the function in a variable and use it later.
- When we assign a function to a property, we call that property a method.


property name must follow JS identifier rules... otherwise, use square-brackets while declaring/accessing them


2 ways to access the property
- Dot notation
    works only if the property names follow the JavaScript rules for identifiers.   
- bracket notation

JS allows us to add or remove Property to an already existing object anytime
remove a property using the delete statement.


Everything is Object in JavaScript
- Javascript has 7 primitive data types string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, and null. 
- Everything else is an object. For example Dates, Functions, arrays are all Objects.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding a new Property
- just by assigning a value
- using the defineProperty method.


Computed Property Names
- use the expression inside the square brackets( [] ) to create computed property name
- earlier = Dynamic Property Name
- now we use expression directly inside the []
- can also invoke a function inside square brackets.
- (or) if enclosed in square-brackets = that property is an expression... JS resolves the expression to a single_value


Trying to access and property that does not exist returns undefined


addProperty() takes any object and adds the property passed in its argument.
- addProperty(obj, key, value)
