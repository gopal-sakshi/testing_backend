Node.js crypto module 
- provides cryptographic functions to help you secure your Node.js app. 
- It includes a set of wrappers for OpenSSLâ€™s 
    hash, HMAC, cipher, decipher, sign, verify functions.

Hash
- For hashed data, a password cannot be decrypted with a predetermined key, unlike encrypted data. 
- An HMAC class is responsible for Hash-based Message Authentication Code, 
    which hashes both key and values to create a single final hash.

Cipher - Decipher
- encrypt data with the `Cipher class` 
- decrypt it with the `Decipher class`.

Sign - verify
- `Verify class` ===> verify encrypted or hashed passwords to ensure they are valid.
- Certificates can also be signed with the `sign class`
