Binary Search
- compares the target value to the middle element of the array. 
- If they are not equal
    the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated
    and the search continues on the remaining half
- Binary search runs in logarithmic time    O(logn)             // n = number of elements in array
- Binary search is faster than linear search except for small arrays.
- However, the array must be sorted first to be able to apply binary search


Hash Tables
- specialized data structures designed for fast searching
- efficient than binary search
- But binary search solves wide range of problems
    finding the next-smallest element in the array relative to target
    finding the next-largest element in the array relative to target                    // if target is absent from array
