Hi, looks like you are running TensorFlow.js in Node.js. 
To speed things up dramatically, install our node backend, visit https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-node for more details.


there are two things
    https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-node     DEPRECATED
    https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs          USE THIS

But if we are using CPU & not GPU
- then use tfjs-node thingy ???
