A generator is a process that can be paused and resumed and can yield multiple values


In a normal function, in fact, we can have only one entry point
- which corresponds to the invocation of the function itself. 

A generator is similar to a function
- but in addition, it can be suspended (using the yield statement) 
- and then resumed at a later time. 
- Generators are particularly useful when implementing iterators
