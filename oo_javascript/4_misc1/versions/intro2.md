`Node releases`
- Node.js major release is updated every six months. 
- The new release becomes the <Current release> for six months
    which gives library authors time to add support for them. 
- After six months
    odd-numbered releases, such as 15, become <unsupported> 
    even-numbered releases, such as 16, move to the <Active LTS (long-term support)> status
- LTS release typically guarantees that critical bugs will be fixed for a total of 30 months. 
- Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases.

`ES modules support`
- ES modules are currently the way to go in JS
- we are using ES modules in frontend, desktop, mobile apps
    but in node, we are stuck with common.js modules
