fetch API ====> API to perform web requests
    we get a response object... but we have to manually extract json object everytime
    we can use axios ===> but its just increases bundle size


response.json()             returns a promise resolved to a JSON object
response.text()             returns a promise resolved to raw text
response.formData()         returns a promise resolved to FormData
response.blob()             returns a promise resolved to a Blob (a file-like object of raw data)
response.arrayBuffer()()    returns a promise resolved to an ArryBuffer (raw generic binary data)


fetch() doesn't throw an error when the server returns a bad HTTP status
    client errors (400–499)
    server errors (500–599)
So, use response.ok property
    set to true only if the response has status 200-299
