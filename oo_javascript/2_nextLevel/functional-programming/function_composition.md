Functional programmers
- define their entire application in terms of function compositions.
- to eliminate the need for temporary variables.
- in functional programming, you’re working with very abstract, generalized functions in which the names of things don’t matter so much. 
    Names just get in the way. 
    You may start to think of variables as unnecessary boilerplate.

In imperative programming
- when you’re performing transformations on some variable
    you’ll find references to the variable in each step of the transformation
