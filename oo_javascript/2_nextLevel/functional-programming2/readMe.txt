JS is multi-paradigm. 
- This can be seen by the fact that
    there are classes =====> but unlike in Java, there is no obligation to use them.
    there are functions; ======> map, filter, reduce
- plus, the class keyword ===> only syntactic sugar
    In the background, classes are actually based on prototype inheritance
