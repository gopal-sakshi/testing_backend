improved readability & maintainability of your code. 
code is self-explanatory
- Lodashâ€™s functional programming approach ====> write code that is more declarative & less imperative. 
- ie instead of telling the computer how to do something step-by-step, 
- you describe what you want it to do. 



const users = [
    { first: 'John', last: 'Doe'},
    { first: 'Jane', last: 'Smith'},
    { first: 'Jim', last: 'Johnson'},
];

const sortedUsers = _.sortBy(users, 'last');
console.log(sortedUsers);
